Ageing is an [**inevitable**]{style="color:#FFD700;"} part of life. @cr-image

The world is ageing [**rapidly**]{style="color:#FFD700;"}. By 2030, 1 in 6 people in the world will be aged 60 years and above.

One of the greatest human accomplishments of the past century was the increase in life expectancy. However, as more people live longer, there is also a worrying gap between [**lifespan**]{style="color:#FFD700;"} and [**healthspan**]{style="color:#FFD700;"}. @cr-image2

It was estimated that humans spent approximately [**9.6 years**]{style="color:#FFD700;"} burdened by disease and poor health at old age. [@cr-image2]{pan-to="0px,-300px"}

As we age, physical function naturally declines leading to [**dependence**]{style="color:#FFD700;"} and [**disability**]{style="color:#FFD700;"}. @cr-image3

One of the hallmarks of ageing is [**muscle loss**]{style="color:#FFD700;"}. No tissue deteriorates with age as profoundly as skeletal muscle. @cr-image4

[**Sarcopenia**]{style="color:#FFD700;"} was a term coined in 1989 by Irwin Rosenberg to recognise age-related loss of muscle mass. [@cr-image4]{scale-by="2"}

Muscle mass begins to decline after [**age 30**]{style="color:#FFD700;"} at an average rate of about [**0.8%**]{style="color:#FFD700;"} per year.

The rate of muscle loss is [**uneven**]{style="color:#FFD700;"}, with lower limb muscles shrinking [**more than twice**]{style="color:#FFD700;"} as fast as upper limb muscles. [@cr-image4]{scale-by="2"} [@cr-image4]{pan-to="-500px,-800px"}

Age-related [**muscle strength**]{style="color:#FFD700;"} declines much faster than the corresponding loss of muscle mass. On average, muscle strength decreases by [**2-4%**]{style="color:#FFD700;"} per year. @cr-image5

Similarly, strength loss with age is greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs.

Since lower limb muscles are essential for mobility, their weakening can significantly impact [**independence**]{style="color:#FFD700;"} and [**quality of life**]{style="color:#FFD700;"}.

It has been posited that [**muscle power**]{style="color:#FFD700;"}, the ability to generate force quickly, is most relevant to performing daily activities of living such as standing up from a chair. @cr-image6

Muscle power decreases with age at a much faster rate as compared to muscle strength and muscle mass, which is associated with increased risk of [**functional decline**]{style="color:#FFD700;"}. [@cr-image6]{pan-to="0px,-300px"}

All hope is not lost. You may slow down the ageing trajectory with good [**nutrition**]{style="color:#FFD700;"} and [**physical activity**]{style="color:#FFD700;"}. @cr-image7

[**Exercise is medicine**]{style="color:#FFD700;"}. Progressive resistance training is the magic pill to counteract age-related loss of muscle.

Take action now and extend your healthspan.
